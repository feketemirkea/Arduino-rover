This rover is my personal project. Currently I'm aiming to migrate the whole project from Arduino to Raspberry, because of the limitations.

As of now the rover has the following features:

 -autonomous driving
 
 -one side parking
 
 -manual control via vluetooth through a smartphone app
 
 -distance sensors
