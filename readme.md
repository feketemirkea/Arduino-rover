This rover is my final project for the university.

The rover has the following features for the arduino side:

 -autonomous driving avoiding front obstacles
 
 -manual control via Bluetooth through a smartphone app made with App inventor
 
 -distance sensors

For the Python side, the program can recognize traffic signs and send commands to Arduino to be executed. A few common signs I used are:

-give way, the car will slow down

-priority, the car will accelerate

-stop, the car will stop

-a figure to represent a clear road

-an arrow, depending on it's orientation, the car will go forward, backward, left, right
